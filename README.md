## What this course about?

This is a svelte course on [udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/sveltejs-the-complete-guide/) from
[max](https://github.com/mschwarzmueller)

Why I choose Svelte over React or Angular nor Vue, cause Svelte is a **compiler** not a framework.

It takes your codes and turns it into vanilla JavaScript that runs in the browser, and not hacking or use non standard
features of web, This make Svelte fundamentally different from Angular, React, Vue or other frameworks.

> I've been deceiving you all. I had you believe that Svelte was a UI framework â€” unlike React and Vue etc, because it
shifts work out of the client and into the compiler, but a framework nonetheless.

> But that's not exactly accurate. In my defense, I didn't realise it myself until very recently. But with Svelte 3 around
the corner, it's time to come clean about what Svelte really is.

At the end why I choose Svelte, Cause Clean, Elegant, No Boilerplate, No weird terminology and everything still works
flawlessly.
